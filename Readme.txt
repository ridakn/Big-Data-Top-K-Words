Hi, 

To run each file, just type in terminal: python filename.py
It will print the execution time. 

There are 5 python files in total, one for each case as explained in the report.

To save the output into a file, run case5.py and it will create an output file with top K words and their frequencies.

I’ve also added in output files in the output folder for top 100 words.

The plots is a Jupyter notebook for all the plots in the report. 

There’s also a pdf file for my report called “Assignment 1 Report - Rida”.
